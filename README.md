# CS61A
My learning materials for the UCB course  CS61A 2018 fall and 2020 fall. I watched 2018 fall course videos and read corresponding slides. I also finished projects, homework, labs and discussions posted on the 2020 fall course website.

The file structure for this repo is listed as follows: 

```

`README.md`:  this file contains the description of this repo.

`hw`:  this folder contains all homework with my solutions.

`lab`: this folder contains all labs with my solutions.

`note`: this folder contains a markdown file with some notes that I find useful for lecture materials, homework and labs. Maybe in the future I will upload my detailed hand-written notes in a pdf file or I will reproduce the detailed notes in a markdown file.

`other`: this folder contains pdf files of discussion session
